# Project Brief: Reusable Azure Landing Zone Modules

## Objective

Design and implement a set of reusable, modular Azure Landing Zone (ALZ) components aligned with Microsoft's Cloud Adoption Framework, enabling consistent, scalable, and customizable infrastructure deployment across different customer environments.

## Scope

This project focuses on delivering opinionated yet flexible Terraform modules for key Azure Landing Zone design areas:

- **Management**
- **Connectivity**
- **Identity**
- **Resource Organization**

Each module will be built on top of **Azure Verified Modules (AVM)** to ensure reliability, and supportability, while layering in custom design logic to reflect preferred architectural patterns and inter-module connectivity.

## Approach

- Leverage **Azure Verified Modules** as the foundation for resource provisioning.
- Define a **modular, opinionated design** for how core ALZ components are connected and configured.
- Ensure **customization and adaptability** per project, so different customers (e.g., Customer A vs. Customer B) can implement varying topologies and configurations without modifying the core modules.
- Promote **reusability** and **ease of integration** within broader infrastructure-as-code environments.

## Outcomes

- A suite of well-documented, reusable Terraform modules for deploying ALZ components.
- Design guidelines and usage examples for customizing modules to specific customer needs.
- Version-controlled, testable infrastructure artifacts ready for production use across multiple projects.
